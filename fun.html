        <p>1. Rule Breakers at Heart – Modernist writers loved breaking traditional storytelling rules, often skipping clear plots or using fragmented sentences to reflect real thoughts.</p>
        <p>2. Inspired by Real Science – Sigmund Freud’s ideas about the subconscious mind heavily influenced Modernist literature, leading to “stream of consciousness” writing styles.</p>
        <p>3. A Reaction to Chaos – Many Modernist works were responses to World War I, capturing the confusion and uncertainty of a rapidly changing world.</p>
        <p>4. Art and Literature Worked Together – Modernism wasn’t just in books — it was also in painting, music, and architecture, with all art forms influencing one another.</p>
        <p>5. Short but Powerful Sentences – Writers like Ernest Hemingway became famous for using very short, direct sentences that still carried deep meaning.</p>
        <p>6. Banned and Controversial – Some Modernist works, such as James Joyce’s Ulysses, were banned at first for being too experimental or “indecent.”</p>
        <p>7. Global Movement – Even though Modernism is often linked to Europe and America, writers from around the world embraced it in their own languages and cultures.</p>
