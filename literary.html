    <H2>POEM : FRAGMENTS</H2>
    <p>Critical Appraisal</p>
    <p2><strong>Themes</strong></p2>
    <br><br>
    <p2><strong>1. Mortality and the Fragility of Life</strong></p2>
    <br>
    <p2>The poem reflects on soldiers shortly before battle, acknowledging that within a week, their bodies‚Äîonce full of strength and beauty‚Äîwill likely be destroyed.
.The ‚Äúgay machine of splendour‚Äù becomes a metaphor for human vitality destined to be broken.</p2>
     <br><br>
<p2>2. War‚Äôs Impending Tragedy</p2>
     <br>
    <p2>Beneath the casual activities (cards, dining), there is an awareness of looming death.
.The contrast between lightheartedness and the shadow of war creates an unsettling tension.</p2>
 <br><br>
<p2>3. Isolation and Observation</p2>
     <br>
    <p2>The speaker is physically present yet unseen, standing apart from the group. This separation gives him a ghost-like, prophetic role.</p2>
<br><br>
<p2>4. Isolation and Observation</p2>
     <br>
    <p2>The speaker is physically present yet unseen, standing apart from the group. This separation gives him a ghost-like, prophetic role.</p2>
<br><br>
<p2>5. Impermanence of Human Presence</p2>
<br>
<p2>The imagery of ‚Äúcoloured shadows‚Äù and ‚Äúfaint bubbles‚Äù emphasises transience‚Äîhumans are momentary figures in a vast, indifferent world.</p2>
<br><br>
<h2>Literary Devices</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Imagery: Vivid descriptions like ‚Äúthinner than filmy glass‚Äù and ‚Äúwave‚Äôs faint light‚Äù create fragile, almost dreamlike visuals.</li>
  <li>
Metaphor: Comparing soldiers to ‚Äúbubbles‚Äù and ‚Äúshadows‚Äù stresses their fragility.</li>
  <li>Juxtaposition: Life inside the lit cabin (warm, safe, social) is contrasted with the darkness outside (cold, fatal, inevitable).</li>
  <li>Alliteration: Phrases like ‚Äúpass like coloured shadows‚Äù and ‚Äúpity, pride‚Äù add musicality while reinforcing ideas.</li>
  <li>Symbolism: Lamplight represents life and warmth; the night symbolises death and the unknown.</li>
  <li>Tone: Reflective, mournful, and tinged with¬†foreboding.</li>
</ul>
<BR>
  <H2><STRONG>Evaluation</STRONG> (strengths and weaknesses)</H2>
  <BR>
    <p2><strong>Strengths</strong></p2>
    <p2>Rich Symbolism & Depth ‚Äì Multiple layers of meaning encourage re-reading and deep interpretation.
Atmospheric Prose ‚Äì Lyrical, almost biblical style enhances the mystical tone.
Universality of Message ‚Äì Speaks to a timeless human desire for meaning, truth, and belonging.
Spiritual Resonance ‚Äì Uses religious and mythological imagery in a way that transcends a single tradition.
</p2>

<br><br>
<p2><strong>Weaknesses</strong></p2>
<p2>Obscurity & Complexity ‚Äì Heavy use of allegory and symbolism may confuse readers unfamiliar with mystical or esoteric traditions.
Loose Narrative Structure ‚Äì Episodic events can feel disconnected, making the plot hard to follow.
Sparse Character Development ‚Äì Figures remain symbolic archetypes, limiting emotional connection.
Limited Accessibility ‚Äì The archaic style and abstract ideas may alienate modern or casual readers.
</p2>

<h2><STRONG>PERSONAL REFLECTION</STRONG></h2>

<p2>SUMANPAL KAUR</p2>
<BR>
  <p>Both The Electric Silence and Rupert Brooke‚Äôs Fragment left me reflecting on life‚Äôs fragility and the quiet beauty within a journey. In The Electric Silence, the narrator‚Äôs river voyage echoed my own pursuit of meaning, with guidance, detours, and moments of renewal along the way. Fragment, on the other hand, brought a sharper awareness of how fleeting our connections can be, portraying comrades on the brink of loss as delicate, ghostlike figures. Working on the story and poem analyzing, I have learn a lot on the literature. Reciting the poem gave me a chance to learn more and get a good experience on the intonation.</p>

  <P>Reading Fragment and The Electric Silence deepened my understanding of Modernism‚Äôs break from tradition and its honest portrayal of life‚Äôs uncertainty. Fragment reflects the era‚Äôs focus on mortality and alienation, showing how joy and loss can exist side by side in fragmented, fleeting moments. The Electric Silence mirrors the Modernist journey of self-discovery, using symbolism and non-linear progression to explore perseverance and truth. Both works challenge readers to think beyond surface meanings, embracing complexity and ambiguity. They reminded me why Modernist literature remains powerful it reflects life as it truly is: uncertain, imperfect, but deeply human</P>

  <P>After reading Fragments by John Masefield, I learned how beauty can be found even in life‚Äôs broken and incomplete moments. The imagery made me reflect on the value of small experiences. Meanwhile, Electric Silence by Adam T. showed me how technology can both connect and isolate people, making me question the nature of true communication. Both works, though different, deepened my appreciation for how literature explores human emotions and connections.</P>

    <P2>YOW THEN HUI</P2>
    <P>Reading Fragment and The Electric Silence gave me two contrasting yet complementary concepts of life. Fragment left me in awe of its mute sorrow, showing me how someone can be overflowing with life and joy but never know that they are at the verge of losing something valuable. The application of "coloured shadows" made me understand that human relationships are as fragile and ephemeral as these shadows and how one should grasp even the smallest moments. On the other hand, The Electric Silence was a symbolic journey, with the meandering river symbolizing the obstacles, diversions, and advice we encounter when working toward our goals. Having guides like the Mad Man and the World Man in the story made me think of the people who have guided me when I've been lost, and that people flocked to illusions made me think of my own choices. Collectively, these books reminded me that the journey of life is uncertain, but each step‚Äîwhether tranquil or tumultuous‚Äîhas purpose if we are willing¬†to¬†notice.</P>

      <P>Reflection ‚Äì The Electric Silence (Short Story)
For me, learning about The Electric Silence meant learning about how Modernist writers use paradoxes, symbolism, and open endings to leave room for multiple interpretations. This story taught me that silence can speak greater things than words.For this project, I researched the literary background of the story, identified its main Modernist traits, and contributed some Fun Facts. I arranged to always keep my group members well informed, throwing in my ideas early, as well as listening to their input. The group functioned well, as responsibilities were split fairly, everyone's viewpoints were respected, and our work was combined into a final presentation.
Reflection ‚Äì Fragments (Poem)
Working with Fragments imparted that the fragmented form of a poem oftentimes parallels human memory, emotion, and experience. While learning this, I also discovered that absence and gaps in writing can be equally meaningful as the text itself. My responsibility was analyzing the structure of the poem, looking into its Imagist influences, and accounting for the deeper emotional impact therein. From here, upon consideration, I actively engaged with other members in discussion, sharing ideas about visuals and interpretations while also contributing toward the refinement of the Fun Facts section. Our pinch of teamwork formed acts of interaction and vulnerable sharing of constructive criticism and support from all sides building the good and rounded analysis.
